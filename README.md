# Three-Phase Half-Wave Rectifier Simulation

This repository contains a simulation of a three-phase half-wave rectifier created in MATLAB Simulink. The project showcases the working of the rectifier with thyristors, allowing for firing angle control and analysis of the system under different types of loads.

## Project Overview

The three-phase half-wave rectifier is a crucial component in power electronics, converting AC to DC while enabling control over the output by adjusting the firing angle of the thyristors. This project simulates:

- The output voltage and current waveforms for multiple firing angles.
- The voltage across the thyristors during operation.
- System behavior under various load types (e.g., resistive, inductive, and mixed loads).
